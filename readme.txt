How to compile the program:
To compile the program first run gcc -o parser parser.c
After the successful compilation, run ./parser <filename>
  where <filename> should be replaced by the real filename.

Assumptions:
1. if you pass ' ' character as your input file, the program goes into an infinite loop.
Don't do it. ;)
